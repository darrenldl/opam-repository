opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "OCaml time handling and reasoning library"
description: """
Features:

- Timestamp and date time handling with platform independent time zone support

  - Subset of the IANA time zone database is built into this library

- Reasoning over time intervals via `timere` objects/expressions, examples:

  - Pattern matching time and intervals. These work across DST boundaries.
 
  - Intersection and union

  - Chunking at year or month boundary, or in fixed sizes

  - Evaluate (sub)expressions with a different time zone (e.g. intersection of 9am to 5pm of Sydney and 9am to 5pm of New York)
